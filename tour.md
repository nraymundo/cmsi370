# React with Hooks Overview and Tour

[Start here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to get to know React with hooks.

## Code Entry Points
* Browser entry: _index.html_
* JavaScript entry: _index.js_
* Application entry: _App.js_ (this is most likely the file where you will start making changes)

## Basic Code-Reading Tips
* Use the `import` statements to figure out where to find what source code
* React with hooks defines a React component as a function whose return value is the content of that component
* Use browser tools (particularly element inspector) to understand how React code eventually becomes web code
